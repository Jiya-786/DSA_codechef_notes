Rotate the array

You are given an integer array 

n

u

m

s

nums. Rotate the array to the right by 

k

k positions, where 

k

k is a non-negative integer.

For example:

Given the array \[10, 20, 30, 40, 50], rotating it two times to the right results in:

First rotation - \[50, 10, 20, 30, 40]

Second rotation - \[40, 50, 10, 20, 30]

You need to implement a solution that operates in-place and uses only 

O

(

1

)

O(1) additional space.

You don’t need to print any values; simply edit the values of the array.



Follow up:

Can you think of multiple approaches to solve this problem? (There are at least three different strategies.)

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.



Each test case consists of two lines:



The first line contains two space-separated integers: N — size of the array K — number of right rotations

The second line contains N space-separated integers — the array elements.

Output Format

For each test case, output the rotated array in a new line (space-separated).
